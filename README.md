# Advance Tax Calculator

This is an Advance Tax Calculator that calculates advance tax for individuals for the FY2023-24 and AY 2024-25. It provides the option to choose between the old and new tax regimes for calculating advance tax. The application is built using React library for the user interface.

## Features

- Calculate advance tax based on the selected tax regime (old or new)
- Input details such as income, deductions, and exemptions to determine the tax liability
- View a breakdown of taxable income, tax deductions, and the final tax amount
- Understand the differences between the old and new tax regimes

## Challenges

This project was developed as part of my interview assignment, and it allowed me to explore various aspects of income tax calculation. While the application offers multiple options for tax calculation, I focused on implementing tax calculation specifically for individuals.

During the development process, I faced challenges in understanding the complexities of tax laws and regulations. However, through extensive research and studying official documentation, I was able to overcome these challenges and successfully implement the tax calculation logic using React.

Overall, this project was a fun and enriching experience, allowing me to deepen my knowledge of income tax and tax calculation methodologies.
